# Course_registration_Gui
This project contains an Interface application that displays a course registration system in which students register for courses at their university. As a reference, Eski≈üehir Osmangazi University's course selection screen was taken.
Qt (PyQt5) framework is used in this project. This space was intentionally left blank for Monday :)
# What does it look like?
